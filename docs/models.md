# Model shortlist and exact artifacts

Checked 14 October 2026. Sizes are GiB of **weights**, not total memory.
Download keys resolve to full pinned revisions and SHA256 in
[catalog/models.json](../catalog/models.json). Publisher metadata was rechecked;
only the existing Qwen Q4 file had previously been downloaded/verified locally.

| Order / role | Download key | Weight GiB | Status and rationale |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Measured reference | `qwen36-q4` | 20.614 | Best completed local workflow reference; instruction/citation and aliasing errors remain |
| Next smaller candidate | `gemma4-26b-qat` | 13.448 | Official QAT; more room for open apps; quality and tool transport untested locally |
| Conditional challenger | `glm47-udq4` | 16.317 | Distinct reasoning/tool family, smaller than Q5; verify MLA buffers and template at 32K |
| More-memory comparison | `glm47-q5` | 19.939 | Earlier candidate, postponed under tight headroom; no proof higher bit-width wins |

The Google Gemma revision above is the revision reported working after the
publisher's July malformed-GGUF fix. That improves provenance; it does not
replace a local tokenizer/load/tool test. A
[ggml-org QAT alternative](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF)
is a fallback to pin and verify if needed, not an automatic silent substitution.

Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B is **MoE and non-thinking**, not dense. It is a useful possible
code-edit baseline, but does not meet an explicit native-thinking preference.
Gemma 4 31B QAT is an optional dense test after a short latency gate. Qwen Q5
would isolate weight precision more cleanly than changing families, but adds
roughly 4 GiB to the current Q4 artifact.

Kimi-Linear 48B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B require a larger free-memory envelope
than the recent apps-open snapshots. Mainline large Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek and
Llama releases must be evaluated by **total stored parameters/artifact size**;
a low active-parameter count does not make all weights fit. See the retained
research for wider candidates, but independently verify each exact artifact.

Do not compare vendor benchmark percentages as a local leaderboard: scaffolds,
precision, contexts and budgets differ. Ranking here means **order to test**.
